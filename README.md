# Football Game Analysis 

## ⚡Introduction
Football (soccer) is one of the most widely followed sports in the world 🌍, and with the increasing availability of computer vision 🤖 and deep learning techniques, analyzing matches at scale has become both feasible and impactful. Traditional football analysis requires manual tagging and human observation 👀, which is time-consuming and often inconsistent.

This project, Football Game Analysis, leverages YOLOv5 🧠 for player and ball detection, K-Means clustering 🎨 to distinguish teams by jersey colors, and a ball-tracking system 🔴⚡ to identify possession in real time. To improve accuracy, the YOLOv5 model is trained on publicly available football datasets 📂, ensuring reliable performance under different stadiums, lighting, and camera angles.

## 🎯Objective
The main objectives of this project are:
* 🎥 Automated Object Detection – Detect players and the ball using YOLOv5.
* 👕 Team Identification – Use K-Means clustering to classify players by jersey color.
* 🔴 Ball Tracking – Follow the ball’s movement across frames.
* 🤝 Possession Detection – Determine which player currently has the ball.
* 📊 Dataset Integration – Train YOLOv5 on football-specific datasets.
* 🚀 Practical Use Cases – Enable real-time analysis for broadcasting, coaching, and fan engagement.
