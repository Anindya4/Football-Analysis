# Football Game Analysis 

## Introduction
Football (soccer) is one of the most widely followed sports in the world 🌍, and with the increasing availability of computer vision 🤖 and deep learning techniques, analyzing matches at scale has become both feasible and impactful. Traditional football analysis requires manual tagging and human observation 👀, which is time-consuming and often inconsistent.

This project, Football Game Analysis, leverages YOLOv5 🧠 for player and ball detection, K-Means clustering 🎨 to distinguish teams by jersey colors, and a ball-tracking system 🔴⚡ to identify possession in real time. To improve accuracy, the YOLOv5 model is trained on publicly available football datasets 📂, ensuring reliable performance under different stadiums, lighting, and camera angles.
