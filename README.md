# **Football Game Analysis**

## **⚡ Introduction**
Football (soccer) is one of the most widely followed sports in the world 🌍, and with the increasing availability of computer vision 🤖 and deep learning techniques, analyzing matches at scale has become both feasible and impactful. Traditional football analysis requires manual tagging and human observation 👀, which is time-consuming and often inconsistent.
This project, Football Game Analysis, leverages YOLOv5 🧠 for player and ball detection, K-Means clustering 🎨 to distinguish teams by jersey colors, and a ball-tracking system 🔴⚡ to identify possession in real time. To improve accuracy, the YOLOv5 model is trained on publicly available football datasets 📂, ensuring reliable performance under different stadiums, lighting, and camera angles.

## **🎯 Objective**
The main objectives of this project are:
* 🎥 Automated Object Detection – Detect players and the ball using YOLOv5.
* 👕 Team Identification – Use K-Means clustering to classify players by jersey color.
* 🔴 Ball Tracking – Follow the ball’s movement across frames.
* 🤝 Possession Detection – Determine which player currently has the ball.
* 📊 Dataset Integration – Train YOLOv5 on football-specific datasets.
* 🚀 Practical Use Cases – Enable real-time analysis for broadcasting, coaching, and fan engagement.

## **🛠️ Methodology**
1️⃣ **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
  * 📂 Use football datasets (downloaded from [here](https://universe.roboflow.com/roboflow-jvuqo/football-players-detection-3zvbc/dataset/1))
  * 🔄 Convert annotations into YOLO format.
  * ✂️ Split into train/val/test.
  * 🎛️ Apply augmentation (rotation, brightness, scaling).

2️⃣ **Object Detection with YOLOv5 🧠**
  * Detect players 👨‍🦱 and ball ⚽ in each frame.
  * High speed ⚡ + accuracy 🎯 make YOLOv5 ideal for real-time use.
  * Handles small object detection (crucial for the ball).

3️⃣ **Team Identification with K-Means 🎨**
  * Extract dominant colors from each player’s bounding box.
  * Apply K-Means clustering to group players 👕👕.
  * Assign dynamic team labels (Team A ⚪ vs. Team B 🔴).
  * Adapts to new games without retraining.

4️⃣ **Ball Tracking 🔴⚡**
  * YOLOv5 detects the ball → tracking ensures continuity.
  * 🌀 Kalman Filter → predicts ball location when occluded.
  * 🎥 Optical Flow → follows motion between frames.
  * Hybrid detection + tracking = smooth ball trajectory.

5️⃣ **Player-Ball Association 🤝**
  * Calculate distance 📏 between the ball and players.
  * Closest player = ball possessor.
  * Enables metrics like:
    * 🕐 Time of possession.
    * 📊 Team possession percentage.
    * 🌍 Heatmaps of possession zones.
   
6️⃣ **Pipeline Integration 🔄**
**The full workflow:**
***📹 Input video → 🧠 YOLOv5 detection → 🎨 K-Means team clustering → 🔴 Ball tracking → 🤝 Player possession → 📊 Analytics.***

📈 **Results & Discussion**
  * ✅ Object Detection: High accuracy in detecting players and reasonable detection of the ball, even in crowded situations.
  * 🎨 Team Identification: Works effectively, though goalkeepers may form separate clusters.
  * 🔴 Ball Tracking: Hybrid approach keeps the ball tracked smoothly during fast passes.
  * 🤝 Possession: Reliable in identifying the player in control of the ball.

**🌍 Applications**
  * 📺 Broadcasting – Real-time possession stats, key event highlights.
  * 🧑‍🏫 Coaching & Strategy – Heatmaps, passing networks, tactical formations.
  * 📊 Sports Analytics – Performance evaluation, event tagging, predictive insights.
  * 🎮 Fan Engagement – Interactive stats, live replays, visual overlays.

**⚠️ Challenges**
  * 🙈 Occlusions: Players/ball hidden in crowded frames.
  * 👕 Similar Jerseys: Difficult to separate teams if colors are alike.
  * ⚽ Small Ball Detection: Still challenging at long distances.
  * 💻 Hardware Demands: Real-time analysis needs high GPU power.

**🔮 Future Work**
  * Use DeepSORT or ByteTrack for better tracking.
  * Add pose estimation 🕺 for activity recognition.
  * Incorporate temporal context (RNNs/Transformers).
  * Optimize inference for ⌚ real-time deployment.

## **✅ Conclusion**
The Football Game Analysis project demonstrates how **computer vision + machine learning** can revolutionize football analytics ⚽📊. Using **YOLOv5 for detection, K-Means for team separation, and ball tracking for possession**, the system produces reliable and interpretable results.
This project paves the way for professional coaching tools, broadcasting enhancements, and fan engagement systems 🚀. With continued improvements in tracking, detection, and efficiency, it can evolve into a comprehensive real-time match analysis platform 🔥.
